          Two key considerations were at the front of cow milk innovation. The first is that over 65 % of the global human population cannot digest the lactose in cow milk of which the vast majority are people of color. The second is that although todayâ€™s cows have been selectively bred to produce 6 times more milk than they did one century ago and 12 times more than they would naturally, traditional methods of selectively breeding were not yielding desired results. Instead, farmers and scientists pursued the path of genetic engineering to give each cow has 2 udders instead of 1 in order to increase the speed and quantity of milk production. Moreover, the cow's milk was engineered to be lactose free to access the global market more successfully. These ideas were integrated into my body when I was created. Instead of the 1 central udder, I have 2 on either side of my body which makes it easy for me to be milked and can produce at least double the amount of milk.
