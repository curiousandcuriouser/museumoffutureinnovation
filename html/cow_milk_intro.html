          Genetic data indicates that cows were first domesticated from wild aurochs about 10,500 years ago in Pakistan, leading to one line, and central Anatolia, the Levant, and Western Iran, leading to the taurine line, which is prominent today. Early on, they were used as money to barter, until becoming further domesticated and used for their <a href="cow_meat_intro.html" class="reference-link">bodies</a>, <a href="cow_skin_intro.html" class="reference-link">skin</a>, and milk.

          As a prey species, cows have an inherent fear of unfamiliar objects, situations, sudden movements., and feel fear when they are alone. It can take up to half an hour to calm down after entering a fear state. To reduce the risk of predation, cows live in herds that have strict social hierarchies. When relaxed, cows can be found eating, ruminating, or lying with their eyes half-closed, which is an indication of relaxation. These activities typically take up to 9 hours of a cow’s day in nature. Due to their evolution as prey animals, cows have a very acute sense of smell and are able to detect odors many kilometers away. In factory farms, they are therefore easily stressed as they smell where other cows have been previously hurt. Today’s cows have been genetically selected for tameness through high killing rates of cows that were 'difficult' to handle. Because cows do not have as many facial muscles, they appear less expressive of pain and injury than humans, so smaller behavioral changes can indicate intense psychological pain and stress. Rolling their tongues or chewing on bars bar chewing are two classic stereotype behavior problems that are an attempt to make up for the lack of activities that they would naturally enjoy.
