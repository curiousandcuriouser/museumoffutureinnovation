          Chickens belong to the order of Galliformes which is directly connected to the birds that survived when all other dinosaurs went extinct. The wild ancestor of the modern-day chicken, the red junglefowl, was domesticated around 8,000 years ago in the East Asian subcontinent when humans took advantage of their predisposition for reproduction when exposed to large quantities of food.  Their <a href="chicken_meat_intro.html" class="reference-link">bodies</a> and eggs have been used as a food source ever since.

          Chickens normally live together in a flock with a distinct hierarchy and spend their days roaming the land, using the cover of trees and bushes to stay safe. A typical day is spent the day searching for seeds and dust-bathing. Chickens have over 30 different vocalizations to communicate with each other and when they make decisions, they take into account their prior experiences and knowledge. Chickens compare themselves to others in their flock and build long-term relationships that are so intense that one chicken might die of grief if their best friend dies. In factory farming, they often live in a cage with space smaller than an A4 paper per hen and have no chance to live out their typical behavior, undergoing immense physical and psychological pain throughout their short life.
