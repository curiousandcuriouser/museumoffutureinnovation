          Male calves were killed within the first 30 days of life if they were not going to be killed for veal. To make the most leather from these young ones, the male fetuses were modified to grow skin at double the speed of female calves leading to excess leather, which could easily be collected once they were killed within their first month. This technique has also been integrated into my body but has been adapted to the leather-<a href="sheep_intro.html" class="reference-link">wool</a> mix which is my skin. As soon as the wool is shorn and air reaches my skin, the skin increases in size and sags, making my body have up to 1.75 times more leather than anticipated.
