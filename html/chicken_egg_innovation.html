          Normally, chickens lay 12 eggs per year, similar to a female humans' reproductive cycle, yet over decades of selective breeding, that number has grown to 300 eggs a year. My ancestors thought this would be enough, but they were wrong.  Soon after this threshold was reached, chickens got brought into laboratories to be experimented on. They were trying to insert a second uterus and ovary to double the number of eggs. After hundreds of deaths due to the experimentation, the project was deemed a failure. When the researchers created me, or rather a previous 'prototype', they incorporated the failed idea of the two uteruses. In other words, I produce over 600 eggs a year. They have been manipulated into being about 1.5 times the normal size. More than anything, making so many of them makes me feel weak and my bones brittle. But the worst thing is that I cannot stop making them. If I had the choice, I would. I think we all would.
