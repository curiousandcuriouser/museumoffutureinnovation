          Sows are either artificially inseminated or confined to racks to breed with a male pig, and then once impregnated, are confined to gestation crates for months until their offspring are born. The floors of these crates are slatted concrete so that urine and feces can fall through. The sows and piglets are moved to farrowing crates, which are metal cages so narrow that the sows cannot even turn around. Here the newborn piglets have their tails removed near the base and their teeth ground down without the use of anesthesia. Mothers and their piglets generally remain in these bedding-less farrowing crates for about four weeks. When her piglets are taken away, the mother is immediately returned to a gestation crate, where she will be inseminated again a mere five days later. Piglets are moved to the nursery and then the finishing crate. Here, they are kept on concrete floors, causing appalling pressure sores, infections, and lameness. They grow extremely quickly because their movement is severely restricted, they are fed calorie-dense foods, and they are selectively bred to grow as fast as possible. After six months of life, they are transported to slaughterhouses and killed for their <a href="pig_meat_intro.tml" class="reference-link">flesh</a> and fat.
