          The most common hypothesis states that sheep descended from mouflon (wild sheep) in Mesopotamia between 11 and 9 thousand BCE.  Initially only kept for their milk and flesh, their wool became more popular over time, leading to selective breeding. Initially, sheep only had wool on their backs, not their sides, that they shed during the warmer season. Over time, sheep were selectively bred to grow wool all over the body and not lose their wool, leading to today's sheep species that need to be sheared by humans.

          As prey animals, sheep have excellent vision and hearing. With visual fields of 270° to 320°, sheep can see behind themselves without turning their heads. Sheep also have an excellent sense of smell and have scent glands in front of their eyes and between the digits on their feet. They can feel a wide variety of emotions, often signaled through ear posture and vocalizations, and are highly sensitive to others' emotions. After the first week of life, lambs often form playgroups that distinguish the sexes, with male groups playing more aggressively and female groups whirling around. From birth, social bonds are extremely important that all throughout their life they prefer to stay with their social group rather than forage at a distance for highly prized food.
