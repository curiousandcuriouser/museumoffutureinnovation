          When a calf is born, they are separated from their mother within the first few hours or days of life. If male, the calf is either killed within the first 30 days of life because he is considered worthless since milk production is impossible, or lives isolated for eight to twelve months and is then killed for veal. If female, the calf is likely to become a cow used for milk. Shortly after their first year of life, a cow is artificially inseminated and carries her calf to term after nine months of pregnancy. After giving birth, their calf is removed often within the first few hours of life just like they were. The cow produces milk for up to 10 months after which the process of impregnation, childbearing, and milk production is repeated until her body does not produce any more milk, which is generally about the age of 4 or 5. These cows are then killed and used for processed meat.
