          The skin of a cow was previously seen as a by-product of the cow meat industry but has become a co-product. Male calves who are not killed for veal when they are older are killed within their first month alive, often for their skin, which is then made into leather. The connection to the <a href="cow_milk_intro.html" class="reference-link">milk</a> and <a href="cow_meat_intro.html" class="reference-link">meat</a> industry runs even deeper, as, after living life on a farm where they are used for milk, female cows are killed and used for meat and leather. The skin of the killed cow is tanned, most of the time using dangerous substances, including formaldehyde, coal-tar derivatives, mineral salts, and various oils, dyes, and finishes, some of which are cyanide-based. These substances are sometimes fatal for the workers and can enter groundwater causing widespread health impacts in the local community. Most leather is tanned using chromium which has causal links to sinus and lung cancers for those working in or living around tanning factories.
