            Broiler sheds are barren except for water and food points with no natural light. Because the sheds are not regularly cleaned, chickens' eyes and respiratory systems can become damaged and infected and their bodies burned because of the ammonia build-up. Because their bodies grow so quickly, they spend most of their time lying down because their legs cannot support their weight. Many die of heart attacks and develop leg deformities due to their speed of growth. If they survive 42 days, they are caught manually and put into boxes, and transported to a slaughterhouse. This is the only time that broiler chickens experience natural elements and sunlight. The chickens who survive the trip are put into chambers in which oxygen is removed, are killed by automated blades, die through CO2 gassing, or are not stunned and religiously slaughtered.
