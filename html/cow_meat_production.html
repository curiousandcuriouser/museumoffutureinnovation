          Veal comes from male calves who live isolated for eight to twelve months and are then killed for their flesh. If female, the calf is likely to become a cow used for milk. After giving birth 4 or 5 times, they cannot produce breast milk anymore and are considered 'spent' of no economic value. 'Spent' cows are transported to a slaughterhouse where they are killed and used for processed meat and pet food.

          Cows specifically created for their meat are ear tagged and dehorned by using special equipment to cut through the bone and horn tissue, which is so painful it causes many calves to have a decreased appetite for up to two weeks. They are often fed hormone growth promotants, so they grow more quickly than usual and so that their flesh has a consistent tenderness and taste for humans. When they are two or three years old, they are killed.
