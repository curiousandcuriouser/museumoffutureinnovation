          When a lamb is born, within weeks, their ears are hole-punched and they undergo mulesing, in which huge chunks of skin are cut from the animals’ backsides without any painkillers. The reason for it is to cause smooth, scarred skin that won't harbor fly eggs in their skin folds, specifically of Merino sheep. In Australia, where more than 50 percent of the world’s merino wool originates, lambs are forced to endure this procedure. Extremely high rates of mortality are considered normal: 20-40 percent of lambs die at birth or before the age of eight weeks from cold or starvation.

          If they survive, sheep are sheared and their wool is collected, but because shearers are usually paid by volume and not by hour, fast work often neglects the welfare of sheep. Often, sheep are left with injuries that are sewn shut on site by workers without any pain relief. After they start producing less wool, almost 10 million Australian sheep are exported to the Middle East for slaughter.  Eighteen percent of sheep die during the 3-6 week transport process; in just one Australian feedlot, 15 000 sheep died from cold in 1983.
