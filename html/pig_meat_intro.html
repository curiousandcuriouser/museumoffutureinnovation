          Pigs were domesticated from wild boars in the Tigris Basin in modern-day Turkey more than 11,000 years ago. Separate domestication took place in China 8,000 years ago. Pigs arrived from the Near East 8,500 years ago and intermixed with European wild boar over the next 3,000 years. From Europe, pigs were introduced in the Americas and Oceania, often becoming feral. Since their first domestication, they have been used for their flesh and <a href="pig_fat_intro.tml">fat</a>.

          Pigs live in small, matriarchal groups and maintain family bonds into adulthood. They are extremely hygienic, creating communal nests to sleep in and designating other spaces for excretion. Because they have few sweat glands, pigs can be found relaxing in water or mud to cool themselves down, after which they will clean themselves off. Searching for food is their main occupation during the day, spending about 75% of their time foraging and rooting, and walking up to 15 kilometers during this time. They can recognize individuals through their acute sense of smell, as well as good hearing. In factory farms, they are forced live in their excrements which can lead to nose and eye infections, as well as being psychologically challenging as they cannot stay clean. While naturally, they would walk large distances over hours searching for food, in factory farms, they are contained within small pens shared with non-family members and receive concentrated food that can be consumed in 15 minutes. This leads to them mutilating others and themselves to due lack of activity.
