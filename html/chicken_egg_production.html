          In order to increase the production of eggs, more layer hens need to be created. This is done by forcefully impregnating hens who then lay eggs that are ‘sexed’, or sorted into male and female when the chicks hatch. All the male chicks are placed on a conveyor belt that ends in a macerator that grinds them to death on their first day of life. The females’ beaks are removed manually or through hot-blade machinery. A chicken’s beak is more sensitive than a human finger, so some chicks immediately die of shock. Debeaking occurs in order to reduce cannibalism, which happens because of unnatural living circumstances and boredom. In order to produce an edible egg, a chicken needs to not be impregnated. It takes 24-26 hours for a hen to internally construct an egg. Eggshells are mostly made of calcium carbonate, and for each shell produced, the hen must mobilize approximately 10% of the calcium stored in her bones. This is the main reason egg-laying hens are so commonly afflicted with osteoporosis, as the unnatural quantity of eggs depletes their bodies of massive amounts of calcium. When they cannot produce eggs anymore, they are killed and made into processed <a href="chicken_meat_intro.html" class="reference-link">meats</a>.
