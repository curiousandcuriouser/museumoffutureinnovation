          Pugs were prized companions in the Chinese Imperial courts and were brought to Europe in the 1500s and grew in popularity until the 1860s when European pugs were interbred with a Chinese pug breed which led to a shortening of their legs and snout. Starting in the 1900s, pugs have been selectively bred to have shorter snouts even more by breeding down nasal cartilage, shorter their limbs to be smaller, and a more compressed face. This breeding has led to immense health issues, such as pinched nostrils, which lead to respiratory distress, protruding eyes that often need to be pushed back into the eye socket, an immense amount of skin folds due to increased body fat leading to infections, and abnormal hip formations and spinal issues that can cause paralysis. Because the size of their heads is large in comparison to the birth canal, the vast majority of pugs need to be birthed via C-section. Starting in the 2000s, the act of retro-breeding pugs has become more common in an attempt to undo health issues.

          Because of all these health issues and the high rate of infant mortality, pugs' corpses are often offered to scientific institutions for research. As such, the pug's head found its way into Aremich Sciences as well and has been integrated into my body. Because of pugs' docile nature and the vast amount of heads available, they were chosen to be my head.
