        <p>
          As my skin, which will be made into <a href="cow_skin_intro.html" class="reference-link">leather</a>, is covered by wool and the shearing process is manually intensive, those who made me created a special layer between my skin and wool that dissolves when placed into water causing the wool to fall out. As such, none of the leather is nicked because of human mishandling and all of the wool can be used even after I have been killed. After entering the water tub, the wool is washed while floating along into a collection basin after which it is transported to a drying station. This process takes only one human supervisor, instead of one human shearer per sheep, allowing for more wool to be processed more quickly.
