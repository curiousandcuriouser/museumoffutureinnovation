            Chickens that have been selectively bred to produce meat are forced to grow 65 times faster than their bodies normally would, making them suffer under the increased weight of the breast region. Researchers started to look into removing the chicken’s legs and enhancing their wings as a way to propel them forward. This has led to the removal of chicken’s legs through genetic manipulation and immense growth of their wings, which are used as leg alternatives, while also increasing the size of the chicken wing portions humans were able to eat. When I was created, they took their ideas about wing size and adapted them to fit my larger body. With the proportions I have, which are similar to the average human, my wings are about half as long as the average arm. This makes the ‘gustatory sensation’ more pleasurable as humans do not have to go through the hassle of eating many chickens’ wings with multiple bones, but only have one large one that they can easily consume. This will lead to less food waste and make large chickens’ wing more environmentally friendly, according to them
