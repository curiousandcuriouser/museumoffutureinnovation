        <p>At my core is my skeleton, which consists of multiple different species' bones. The difference in skeletal systems was initially extremely difficult to overcome for the scientists at Aremich Sciences, so they moved towards integrating the bones directly by analyzing their constitution and combining their common components, creating a hybrid bone. As such, my bones can be used for all combined purposes that pig's, chicken's, sheep's, and cow's have previously been used for.
