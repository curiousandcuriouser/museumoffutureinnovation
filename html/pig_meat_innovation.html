          By finding a way to separate fat and muscle tissue, researchers were able to create more concentrated muscles in my legs. which lends itself to less fatty meat products and therefore supposedly healthier end products. Moreover, being engineered to stand upright minimizes the amount of skin and underlying flesh that is touching the ground, therefore reducing the chance of sores, lameness, and infections, in turn making us more profitable. Finally, we are removed from having any connection to others of our kind to sever any emotional attachment we could have had and therefore make us taste better. since we do not feel loss. I am not sure if they succeeded though because I remember thinking and feeling all the pain, physical and emotional, even though, or perhaps because, I had never met someone like me.
