        <p>
          In order to minimize the work and interactions with us, we were given a pug face without horns, so the dehorning procedure was obsolete. They also changed to the process of feeding us hormone growth promotants to giving us a hormone implant that would be removed after we were killed. This hormone implant had the instructions for what type of meat should be grown at the center of our body, ranging from brisket to tenderloin, including all possible cuts. We are still killed when we are three years old, but we feel so much older. Because my body was forced to grow so quickly and in such unnatural ways, there is this constant aching pain streaming through me. These two years have felt like forever, but I cannot let myself entertain the thought of not telling you about what it is happening. Any pain happening to me is worth it if it means that someone else's will be prevented.
